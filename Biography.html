            <p> I am yohannes solomon. I was born on july 3 1991, in muger and my parents are solomon
                fikru and meserete fekadu. I have two young siblings. I am the eldest in my family. I attend
                kinder garten upto eighth reji primary school. While there i participated in football club. From
                grade ninth upto 12th i attended at muger community secondary and preparatory school. That time was
                so hard for me because i had to go long distance from school to home and from home to school. I devoted
                myself to study hard which helped me to pass university entrance ecamination with good grade. After schoring
                good grade I joined addis ababa university which i am proud of a lot. I am currently learning in 
                Ethiopian institute of architecture and construction. I am striving to achieve a good grade and graduate
                with distinciton. I serve my community with knowledge and skill i have got.
