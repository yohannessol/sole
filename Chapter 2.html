            <h1><br> History of Biotechnology </h1>
        <p>
            Although not normally what first comes to mind, many forms of human-derived agriculture clearly 
            fit the broad definition of "'utilizing a biotechnological system to make products". Indeed, the 
            cultivation of plants may be viewed as the earliest biotechnological enterprise.

Agriculture has been theorized to have become the dominant way of producing food since the Neolithic Revolution. 
Through early biotechnology, the earliest farmers selected and bred the best suited crops, having the highest
 yields, to produce enough food to support a growing population. As crops and fields became increasingly large 
 and difficult to maintain, it was discovered that specific organisms and their by-products could effectively 
 fertilize, restore nitrogen, and control pests. Throughout the history of agriculture, farmers have 
 inadvertently altered the genetics of their crops through introducing them to new environments and
  breeding them with other plants — one of the first forms of biotechnology.

These processes also were included in early fermentation of beer. These processes were introduced
 in early Mesopotamia, Egypt, China and India, and still use the same basic biological methods. In brewing,
  malted grains (containing enzymes) convert starch from grains into sugar and then adding specific yeasts to 
  produce beer. In this process, carbohydrates in the grains broke down into alcohols,e such as ethanol. Later, 
  other cultures produced the process of lactic acid fermentation, which produced other preserved foods, such as soy
   sauce. Fermentation was also used in this time period to produce leavened bread. Although the process of fermentation
    was not fully understood until Louis Pasteur's work in 1857, it is still the first use of biotechnology to convert a food source into another form.

Before the time of Charles Darwin's work and life, animal and plant scientists had already used selective breeding.
 Darwin added to that body of work with his scientific observations about the ability of science to change species.
  These accounts contributed to Darwin's theory of natural selection. For thousands of years, humans have used selective breeding to improve the production of crops and livestock 
to use them for food. In selective breeding, organisms with desirable characteristics are mated to produce offspring with the same characteristics. For example, this technique was used with corn to produce the largest and sweetest crops.[10]

In the early twentieth century scientists gained a greater understanding of microbiology and explored ways 
of manufacturing specific products. In 1917, Chaim Weizmann first used a pure microbiological culture in an 
industrial process, that of manufacturing corn starch using Clostridium acetobutylicum, to produce acetone, 
which the United Kingdom desperately needed to manufacture explosives during World War I.

Biotechnology has also led to the development of antibiotics. In 1928, Alexander Fleming discovered
 the mold Penicillium. His work led to the purification of the antibiotic compound formed by the mold 
 by Howard Florey, Ernst Boris Chain and Norman Heatley – to form what we today know as penicillin.
  In 1940, penicillin became available for medicinal use to treat bacterial infections in humans.
The field of modern biotechnology is generally thought of as having been born in 1971 when Paul Berg's 
(Stanford) experiments in gene splicing had early success.
<P> Herbert W. Boyer (Univ. Calif. at San Francisco)
 and Stanley N. Cohen (Stanford) significantly advanced the new technology in 1972 by transferring genetic 
 material into a bacterium, such that the imported material would be reproduced.
