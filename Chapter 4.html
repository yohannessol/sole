            <h1><br> Definition of Bio technology </h1>
            <P> The wide concept of biotechnology encompasses a wide range of procedures 
                for modifying living organisms according to human purposes, going back to
                domestication of animals, cultivation of the plants, and "improvements"
                to these through breeding programs that employ artificial selection
                and hybridization. Modern usage also includes genetic engineering 
                as well as cell and tissue culture technologies. The American Chemical
                Society defines biotechnology as the application of biological organisms,
                 systems, or processes by various industries to learning about the science of life and
                 the improvement of the value of materials and organisms such as pharmaceuticals, crops,
                 and livestock. Per the European Federation of Biotechnology, biotechnology is the
                integration of natural science and organisms, cells, parts thereof, and molecular analogues
                 for products and services. Biotechnology is based on the basic biological sciences 
                 (e.g. molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, embryology, genetics, microbiology) and 
                 conversely provides methods to support and perform basic research in biology.</P>
                <p>Biotechnology is the research and development in the laboratory using 
                    bioinformatics for exploration, extraction, exploitation and production 
                    from any living organisms and any source of biomass by means of biochemical
                     engineering where high value-added products could be planned (reproduced by
                      biosynthesis, for example), forecasted, formulated, developed, manufactured,
                       and marketed for the purpose of sustainable operations (for the return from
                        bottomless initial investment on R & D) and gaining durable patents rights 
                        (for exclusives rights for sales, and prior to this to receive national and 
                        international approval from the results on animal experiment and human experiment, 
                        especially on the pharmaceutical branch of biotechnology to prevent any undetected 
                        side-effects or safety concerns by using the products). The utilization of 
                        biological processes, organisms or systems to produce products that are anticipated
                         to improve human lives is termed biotechnology.

                    By contrast, bioengineering is generally thought of as a related field that more heavily 
                    emphasizes higher systems approaches (not necessarily the altering or using of biological
                     materials directly) for interfacing with and utilizing living things. Bioengineering 
                     is the application of the principles of engineering and natural sciences to tissues,
                      cells and molecules. This can be considered as the use of knowledge from working with
                       and manipulating biology to achieve a result that can improve functions in plants and 
                       animals.Relatedly, biomedical engineering is an overlapping field that often draws 
                       upon and applies biotechnology (by various definitions), especially in certain
                        sub-fields of biomedical or chemical engineering such as tissue engineering, 
                        biopharmaceutical engineering, and genetic engineering.

                    Brewing and baking bread are examples of processes that fall within the concept of 
                    biotechnology (use of yeast (= living organism) to produce the desired product). Such 
                    traditional processes usually utilize the living organisms in their natural form (or 
                    further developed by breeding), while the more modern form of biotechnology will generally 
                    involve a more advanced modification of the biological system or organism. With the development
                    of genetic engineering in the 1970s, research in biotechnology (and other related areas such as medicine, 
                    biology etc.) developed rapidly because of the new possibility to make changes in the organisms'
                     genetic material (DNA). Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (eg. genetics,
                      biochemistry, molecular).
